# Doing a Shift: Slack Channels

While working on a shift, you will likely find yourself accessing a number of different Slack channels in the Flatiron Staff team. Below is a brief overview of what some of these channels are. For more in depth information, check out the resources at the end of this lesson.

## #technical-coaches
The `#technical-coaches` channel is used for doing your shift and all shift related content. It's also used to greet your peers and a little chat. Please try not to flood technical coaches with chat however, if it's an in depth discussion, you can always do a group DM.

## #labs-escalation
The `#labs-escalation` channel is read-only - any time a JIRA ticket is filed by a TC, a message will be posted to this channel. This channel is not to be used as a chat, but can be used to post necessary escalations by TCs (e.g. Expert Chat is down).

## #tc-updates
The `#tc-updates` channel is used by the Technical Coach Leads, Technical Coach Manager, or other Departments to keep Technical Coaches updated on various issues. Other departments such as engineering may use this channel if learn.co or github is down. This channel is not to be used as a chat or to post escalations. 

## #tc-support
The `#tc-support` channel is used for finding already answered questions as well as asking your own questions. You will want to first do a search for a question you might have. If there are no questions already answered in that topic, open your own thread with the question. Technical Coaches will then reply to any question you may have as threaded replies.
