# Submitting a Pull Request

In some cases, the fix for the problem can be simple enough for you to make a PR on it. Make the PR, and follow the guidelines in the Raising an Issue section on how to write a good title. In a comment in the PR, indicate that you're a Technical Coach and what the PR fixes. Be as specific as you can. 

Below is a video showing how to submit a pull request to improve curriculum on Learn. If the PR includes any kind of changes to the Gemfile/package.json, make sure that `bundle install`/`npm install` works and that the tests run properly after the change. If your change has anything to do with the tests, make sure that the code in the solution branch also works with your change. And, of course, make sure that you also make the update to the solution branch if it involves a change in the tests.

It's also a good idea to reference any issues that your PR may be resolving. You can do this by adding a # in front of the number that corresponds to the issue. (If the issue is tagged #9, you can say resolves #9 in your PR and they will be automatically linked together)

Also, be sure to @mention the section lead in charge of the section of the curriculum to which the lesson belongs. You can find that info [here](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/learn-instructors.md#sections).
