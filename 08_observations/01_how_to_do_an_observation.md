# How To Do A Peer Observation

## Doing the Observation

Each Technical Coach is required to do 2 peer observations each month. This helps TC's identify their strengths and weak points and improve their skills, and ultimately enhance the students' learning experience. 

### Shadowing on Sync

If the TC you're shadowing is on Sync:

* Wait for the technical coach to get paired with a student
* Follow the technical coach to their zoom link, don't respond to anything, just observe
* Take some notes on how they handle the student
  * What are they doing well? What can they improve on?
  * Contextual notes help as well for giving feedback
* After the TC wraps up the pairing, DM the TC you shadowed on Slack with your feedback
* [Fill out this form with your notes and feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOIlOz585-yyF2PhWzpZykipKV4CrqvD1STZLilhhTdvSrLw/viewform?fbzx=-1649285253627795000)
* Log your time in WorkDay

### Shadowing on Dispatch

If the TC you're shadowing is on Dispatch:

* First find a chat they are helping with
* Take some notes on how they handle the student
  * Did they ask them how they are? 
  * Were they polite?
  * Based on the question did they offer a pair programming session?
  * How are they handling questions as a whole, do they respond to every student?
  * Are they trying to take too many questions without queuing up students?
* After you finish taking notes, DM the TC you shadowed on Slack with your feedback
* [Fill out this form with your notes and feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOIlOz585-yyF2PhWzpZykipKV4CrqvD1STZLilhhTdvSrLw/viewform?fbzx=-1649285253627795000)
* Log your time in WorkDay


## Giving Effective Feedback

After submitting the feedback form, be sure to DM the TC you shadowed on Slack. If it's not busy, feel free to `qbot out` for 5 - 10 minutes to give your feedback over a screenshare.

When giving feedback to a peer, we want it to be as helpful as possible, whether it's positive or negative. We want to be specific instead of vague. We also want to base our feedback on behaviors we directly observed and not on qualities of the TC. It's best to start with some positive feedback (glows), follow up with negative feedback (grows), and wrap up with an action plan to improve the areas subject to negative feedback.

Be direct - don't beat around the bush. While giving feedback to peers (especially negative feedback) might be tough, people generally appreciate direct and honest feedback if it's well delivered. Negative feedback is perfectly acceptable and encouraged as long as it's constructive.

It might also be useful to ask the TC if there was anything they think they did well, that they could have done better on, and if there was, how they can improve on it. 

End the session with an action plan to fix the negative behaviors, if there were any observed. The action plan can be suggested by you, the person you observed, or as a collaborative effort - as long as their is a plan in place to address it. 


### SBI Framework

The SBI framework, or Situation Behavior Impact framework, is a good framework for giving effective feedback.

**Situation**: Define the what and where. 
* Today during your screenshare with Jonathan

**Behavior**: Describe the specific behavior(s) you observed
* I think you lead the conversation too much instead of letting Brad speak more.
* I saw you were using a lot of annotations
* I noticed you greeted the student and immediately put them at ease

**Impact**: Use “I” statements to describe the effect you predict for them, or the student
* I think (leading the conversation too much) will prevent the student from learning how to think through the problem
* I think (using annotations) helps focus the students attention on the important parts of the problem
* I think (greeting the student) makes them comfortable and be able to articulate their problem better

### Feedback Sandwich

The Feedback Sandwich is another good method of giving feedback to a peer. This method consists of giving a piece of positive feedback, followed by some negative feedback, and completed with another piece of positive feedback. However, if you're delivering a hard message, the final piece of positive feedback may come across as disingenous - as if you're trying to offset the negative feedback you just delivered. For this reason, we recommend using the SBI framework, but you can use this method if you feel it's appropriate.
