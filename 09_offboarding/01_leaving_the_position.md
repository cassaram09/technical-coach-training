# Leaving the Technical Coach Position

Given that most technical coaches are recent grads of the full stack program, I expect most of you are looking for a full time position while you work as a TC. This is of course totally acceptable! As you need time off for interviews or to go to meet-ups, please just make sure to schedule them off in WhenIWork before the prior Wednesday. As you are looking to leave the position, there are two things to please keep in mind:

## Two Weeks Notice
Just like any other professional position, I am expecting that you will give me two weeks notice so that I can make sure there are no gaps in coverage :)

## References
Unfortunately, the TC manager is unable to act as a professional reference because this is contract work and TCs are not employees of Flatiron. The TC manager is able to confirm that you've worked in this role and the responsibilities that this role entails.
