?: What's the first step of the debugging process?

(X) Look at the error message and identify the problem
( ) Look at the student's code
( ) Have the student explain the error

?: How do we break down a student's code? 

(X) Identify what the code should do, what the inputs are, what the expected outputs are, and any edge cases
( ) Break it down into smaller components
( ) Ask the student what their code does
 
?: When using the Socractic method, we should:
